            Dear <span class="player">Player 456</span>,
            <br><br>
            Welcome to Squid Game.
            <br><br>
            The door is now shut forever. There is no escape.
            <br>
            The world you knew previously is gone. There is no outside, no mercy and not even a second chance.
            <br><br>
            Your name has disappeared forever and your number now determines your destiny.
            <br><br>
            Every breath, every step and every choice you make shall decide your fate — survive or vanish.
            <br><br>
            The rules are absolute. Disobey, and enjoy an instant and fun death.
            <br><br>
            Win, and everything is yours.
            <br><br>
            Lose, and you shall disappear without a trace, echo or even a single memory.
            <br><br>
            Survive, or be erased from existence.
            <br><br>
            Remember: The Front Man watches the game 24/7, so be careful — No escape and breaking of rules.
            <br><br>
            The game officially begins now.
